                        <h3>How Autonomous Vehicles Think?</h3>
                        <p>A self-driving vehicle requires to have the ability to answer four basic questions about where is it, what's around it, what will happen next, what should it do, at the most fundamental level.</p>
                        <ol class="li-space-lg">
                            <li>Mapping</li>
                                <p>The autonomous vehicle contains pre-built, detailed 3D maps which highlight information such as crosswalks, sidewalks, traffic lights, lane markers, stop signs and other road features. Knowledge of state and local traffic laws and regulations are included in it. The vehicle can precisely determine its location on the road and operate safely with real-time sensor data.</p>
                            <li>Scanning</li>
                                <p> The vehicle is constantly scanning for objects around it. Thevehicle can see up to 300 metres away in every direction. It can identify and differentiate other road users. When it comes to traffic signals, it also knows what different colours mean whether the light is green and clear to proceed or red and need to stop.</p>
                            <li>Anticipating</li>
                                <p>The AI understands that the behaviour of pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists can vary dramatically. Pedestrains move slower than both cyclists and motorcyclists but they can change directions more suddenly. The AI is constantly learning and improving its ability to understand how different road users are prone to behave and anticipate what they will do next. The AI also takes into account how changing road conditions like a blocked lane up ahead may impact how other road users behave.</p>
                            <li>Responding</li>
                                <p>The AI considers all of these information to find out the precise direction, steering maneuvers and speed required for the vehicle to proceed along its route safely. The AI can respond quickly and safely to changes on the road because it is constantly monitoring the environment and predicting the upcoming behaviour of other road users around the vehicle in all directions.</p>

                        <p>There're 5 different levels as not all autonomous driving technology is the same.  A fully autonomous system contains both software and hardware which can carry out all driving functions when incorporated into the vehicle. It is patterned to work without a human driver.</p>

                        <p>The road is not as safe as it should be because of drunk driving, distracted driving, texting while driving. Fully autonomous driving technology are believed to change the way how the world operate and save thousands of lives lost to accidents every year.</p>

                        <p>Autonomous vehicles can see in all directions at once. They never get drunk, tired or distracted unlike humans.  Sensors are constantly monitoring signals, other road users and lights to react to changes quickly. These vehicles have the potential to save lives and money spent due death and injuries caused by road accidents, most of which involve human error.</p>
